# ChaosEngineCPP
 The first version that was created in E language has been left behind because of a serious problem of that language.
 Then I had tried reconstructing in some other languages, but finally I chose C++ to finish this project for its powerful capabilities.

 This engine only used DirectX for graphics rendering, so the games made by it can only run on Windows.

 Now, a new version of ChaosEngine for C++ is growing...
